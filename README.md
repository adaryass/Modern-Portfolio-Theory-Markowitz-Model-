# Modern-Portfolio-Theory-Markowitz-Model-
Explored Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz Model), focusing on diversification, mean-variance analysis, the efficient frontier, Sharpe ratio, and the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) to build optimal portfolios and balance risk with expected return.

We studied key concepts including:

* **Diversification**: Reducing risk by investing in a variety of assets that do not perfectly correlate with each other.
* **Mean and Variance**: Measuring the expected return (mean) and risk (variance or standard deviation) of asset returns.
* **Efficient Frontier and Sharpe Ratio**: Identifying the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk, and using the Sharpe ratio to evaluate performance.
* **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**: Combining a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets to find the best risk-return trade-off.

In practice, we implemented Python code to:

* Download historical stock data (2012â€“2025) using the *yfinance* library for a selected group of companies: AAPL, WMT, TSLA, GE, AMZN, DB, and NVDA.
* Visualize the data using an interactive plot (via *plotly*), showing the closing prices of these stocks over time.

This sets the groundwork for further analysis, such as computing returns, portfolio optimization, plotting the efficient frontier, and calculating the Sharpe ratio.


This chart shows the evolution of closing prices for six major stocks (AAPL, WMT, TSLA, GE, AMZN, DB) from 2012 to 2024.
